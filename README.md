# C-Kit:  Communication box for disaster areas

## What it will be
The "C-Kit" is a small box, that contains several devices to establish a net for communication in disaster areas. It works independently from external power. It is a small, cheap and easy to use "**C**ommunication-**Kit**".

It has some accumulators on board to get started immediately. As the charge of these accumulators will not last for too long, there will be some photovoltaic panels inside the box, as well as a wind turbine for recharging the accumulators to be able to provide service during the night.

Once powered-up it will provide a wi-fi-network with a radius of about 100 m. I will look for a relay station to get in touch with. Once they are coupled, they are looking for other C-Kits. From outside of the disaster-area there will an other kind of C-Kit, which are connected to the internet where possible and available. From there the internet will be connected to the C-Kits on the edge.
An enhancement may be a different antenna for bigger connection area.

Once some C-Kits got connected, they will provide a small website, where people can connect with their mobiles and send some basic information to the rescue workers. For example: How many persons are alive, how many injured people are there, how serious are their injuries and things like that.

As hardware there shall be a SoC system like a Raspberry Pi. It may be any other device, too. As long as it provides Wi-Fi.

## Requirements
- Small and light. A person shall be able to carry at least four of the C-Kits over a long walk.
- robust, so it may be deployed from an airplane and falls back to earth with a little parachute.
- It must be **CHEAP**
- Easy to use. People being able to read, shall be able to make it work.
- Resillient against environmental conditions, like rain, snow, strong sunlight, small particles (e.g. sand, dust, leaves)
- Easy to fix on roofs, walls, trees, masts, ..

## Everybody is welcome to contribute
This is the "first idea". It will be elaborated over time. You are heartily welcome to contribute, as HW-specialist, as developer, as integrator, as rescue worker to provide requirements .... any one who has any idea or feedback.

A disaster could happen tomorrow in your street. So this is a small contribution to be prepared.


# The drawings of the C-Kit box

All drawings are intended as a starting point of a discussion; in the sense of "a picture tells more than 1,000 words"
If you have a better idea or enhanced design, please feel free to change it.
